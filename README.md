# Association between smoking during pregnancy and environmental tobacco smoking variables
PHP2550 Project 1
## Overview:
This project is a collaboration with Dr. Lauren Micalizzi from the Department Behavioral and Social Sciences. Exposure to smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) are two of the most ubiquitous and hazardous of children’s environmental exposures. Seven to 15% of infants born per year are exposed to SDP and more than 25% of children are exposed to household ETS. SDP alone imposes a $4 billion annual economic burden due to health-care costs. Early smoke-exposure increases rates of externalizing behaviors in children, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and rates of substance use problems, all of which have clear public health implications. Early smoke exposure is also linked to self-regulation problems (i.e., the maintenance of physiological, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive control).

## Objective
The purpose of Dr. Micalizzi’s research is to examine the association between smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure and self-regulation, externalizing behavior, and substance use. The women in this study were recruited from a previous study on smoke avoidance intervention to reduce low-income women’s (N=738) smoking and ETS exposure during pregnancy and children’s exposure to ETS in the immediate postpartum period. A subset of adolescents (N=100) and their mothers are randomly selected for recruitment into this study. You will have access to the baseline data; two longitudinal follow up assessments occur at 6- and 12-months post-baseline.
My main objective was to examine effects of SDP/ETS on adolescent self-regulation, substance use, and externalizing.

## Methods
I worked on doing missing and exploratory data analysis. I used R software to construct tables and plots comparing groups of SDP/ETS to variables describing adolescent self-regulation, substance use, and externalizin. These tables include p-values to determine if the relationships I found were statistically significant. 
I recieved cleaned and preprocessed data. I simply had to preprocess some minor details relating to the missing values. I worked on doing missing and exploratory data analysis. I used R software to construct tables and plots comparing groups of SDP/ETS to variables describing adolescent self-regulation, substance use, and externalizin. These tables include p-values to determine if the relationships I found were statistically significant. 

## Conclusion

In this report, we conducted missing and exploratory data analysis of the data provided. We found that the data is MAR(missing at random). We showed this thru visuals, examples and tables. We also found significant relationships between SDP and adolescent self-regulation, substance use, and externalizing. This relationship was not as easily visible for ETS, however we did find some relationships between ETS and adolescent substance use. 
The main set back of the study was the low number of observations. This could lead to high bias among our results. More importantly, the low number of observations decreased the statistical power of the study. Another set back of the study is having more observations than variables. Often this leads to high data sparsity, which ddidn't allow us to deal with missing data through imputaions.
